# Be careful with launchSettings.json, often ignored for secrets but sometimes kept for team config.
# Given it's a student/demo project, maybe keep launchSettings unless it has secrets? 
# Usually it has environment variables. I will ignore it to be safe, or just ignore secrets.json.
# Standard .NET ignore usually ignores launchSettings.json if it contains secrets.
# For now, I'll ignore bin and obj which are the most important.
